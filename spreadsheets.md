| VLOOKUP | Row-wise (V for vertical) search. |
| =text(A1, "mm-dd-yy") | Format date in A1 to text. |
| =SPARKLINE(A1:A10, {"charttype", "column" ; "color", "blue"}) | Plot range A1:A10 as a blue column chart that fits a single cell.|
| =COUNTIF(A:A, A1) | Count duplicates of A1 in column A |
| =LINEST(y_data, x_data) | Linear fit that returns both SLOPE and INTERSECT. Note that x_range can span multiple columns. |
| =RAND() | Yields a random number. |
| =UNIQUE() | Unique rows in the provided range. Useful when calculating group statistics with COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF, etc.|
| =AVERAGEIF() | Average of values depending on criteria.|
| =FORECAST(x, y_data, x_data) | Expected y-value based on linear regression. |

| Pivot table | Reorganize/Groub by/Summarize/Accumulate data. Also, digging into a pivot table is a handy way to filter/explore datasets.|
| Conditional formatting | Highlight cells based on conditions such as thresholds and matches. Regex available for text conditions.|
| Named ranges | Ranges, and individual cells, can be named, so that they are clearer to use. This also makes references more reliable when, for example, adding new rows within the range.|
| Data validation | Allows to greate interactive checkboxes, dropdown lists, text fields, etc. |
| Hide Column | Hide duplicate columns, for example they might have different formats. |
| Sampling | Use RAND() and Sort by column to sample rows. |
